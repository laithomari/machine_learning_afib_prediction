# Machine Learning to Predict the Development of Atrial Fibrillation in Critically Ill Patients
This is the repository for our recent project that uses machine learning to predict atrial fibrillation in critically ill patients. We used data from Medical Information Mart
for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. The model achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.850. A compact model using 15 features in addition to 2 newly engineered
features achieved a comparable AUC of 0.820. The paper derived from this algorithm was submitted. Attached code is for reference purposes only.
